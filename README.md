### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<!--
**Thomas-S-J/Thomas-S-J** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on whatever I feel like
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning whatever I feel like
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on stuff
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stuff
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Email
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He, him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm new to this. Thats why this profile is so silly 
--> Have fun.
